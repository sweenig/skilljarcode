Build:

docker build --tag skilljar .


Run:
Use the following command, replacing [full_path_to_creds.json] with the full path to your creds.json file. This can't be a relative path. However, if the current directory contains the json file, you can use
`pwd`\creds.json

docker run --rm -it -v [full_path_to_creds.json]:/usr/src/app/creds.json skilljar

If you want to setup an alias, modify your ~/.bash_profile (assuming you're using bash and not zsh) to contain this line:
alias skilljar='docker run --rm -it -v [full_path_to_creds.json]:/usr/src/app/creds.json skilljar'
